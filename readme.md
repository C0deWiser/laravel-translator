## Introduction

Polyglot provides a beautiful translation editor and can extract translations strings from the application source codes.

Using Polyglot you may be sure, that you application is fully localized.

> Before digging into Polyglot you should familiarize yourself with [Gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/).

## Installation

Install [Gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) on your server and make sure, that php has `ext-gettext` extension enabled.

You may install Polyglot into your project using the Composer package manager:

    composer require codewiser/polyglot

After installing Polyglot, publish its assets using the `polyglot:install` Artisan command:

    php artisan polyglot:install

## Configuration

After publishing Polyglot's assets, its primary configuration file will be located at `config/polyglot.php`. This configuration file allows you to configure Polyglot working modes. Each configuration option includes a description of its purpose, so be sure to thoroughly explore this file.

### Working modes

    'mode' => env('POLYGLOT_MODE', 'editor'),

Polyglot supports three working modes:

* `editor`
  
    Polyglot works only as translation online editor.

* `collector`

    Polyglot may find and extract translation strings from the application source codes.

    Collected strings will be placed into `resource/lang` directory, modifying existing files. 

* `translator`

  Polyglot replaces Laravel Translation Service, bringing all Gettext power to your application. With full backward compatability, however.

### Source codes

Polyglot scans files and folders, that are configured in `sources` property. It may be as a folder, as a single file, or an array with any filesystem resources.

    'sources' => [
        app_path(),
        resource_path('views')
    ],

Meanwhile, you may exclude some resources from being scanned.

    'exclude' => resource_path('views/auth'),

After collecting strings, Polyglot will populate collected strings through every configured locale.

    'locales' => ['en_US', 'en_GB', 'it', 'es'],

> Other configurable settings will be described below.

### Dashboard Authorization

Polyglot exposes a dashboard at the /polyglot URI. By default, you will only be able to access this dashboard in the local environment. However, within your `app/Providers/PolyglotServiceProvider.php` file, there is an authorization gate definition. This authorization gate controls access to Polyglot in non-local environments. You are free to modify this gate as needed to restrict access to your Polyglot installation.

    /**
     * Register the Polyglot gate.
     *
     * This gate determines who can access Polyglot in non-local environments.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    protected function gate()
    {
        Gate::define('viewPolyglot', function ($user) {
            return in_array($user->email, [
                'username@example.com',
            ]);
        });
    }

#### Alternative Authentication Strategies

Remember that Laravel automatically injects the authenticated user into the gate closure. If your application is providing Polyglot security via another method, such as IP restrictions, then your Polyglot users may not need to "login". Therefore, you will need to change `function ($user)` closure signature above to `function ($user = null)` in order to force Laravel to not require authentication.

## Upgrading Polyglot

When upgrading to any new Polyglot version, you should re-publish Polyglot's assets:

    php artisan polyglot:publish

To keep the assets up-to-date and avoid issues in future updates, you may add the `polyglot:publish` command to the `post-update-cmd` scripts in your application's `composer.json` file:

    {
        "scripts": {
            "post-update-cmd": [
                "@php artisan polyglot:publish --ansi"
            ]
        }
    }

## Strings Collector

Once you have configured mode to `collector` in your application's `config/polyglot.php` configuration file, you may collect strings using the polyglot Artisan command. This single command will collect all translation strings from the configured sources:

    php artisan polyglot:collect
  
Polyglot uses `xgettext` to collect translation strings, understanding even `trans`, `trans_choice`, `@trans` and other Laravel specific directives.

After collecting strings your application's `resourse/lang` folder may look like:

    resources/
      lang/
        es/
          auth.php
          passwords.php
        en_GB/
          auth.php
          passwords.php
        en_US/
          auth.php
          passwords.php
        it/
          auth.php
          passwords.php
        es.json
        en_GB.json
        en_US.json
        it.json

You only left to translate files.

## Gettext Translator

As Laravel Translator may hold strings in different files (that we call namespace), so Gettext may hold strings in different files (that is called domains). The idea is alike, but there are a lot of difference.

Gettext may split strings by categories, described by php constants `LC_MESSAGES`, `LC_MONETARY`, `LC_TIME` and so on.

By default, Polyglot stores collected strings on `messages` domain in `LC_MESSAGES`category.

So, if you have configured Polyglot mode to `translator`, after you run `polyglot:collect` Artisan command, your application's `resourse/lang` folder may look like:

    resources/
      lang/
        es/
          LC_MESSAGES/
            messages.po
        en_GB/
          LC_MESSAGES/
            messages.po
        en_US/
          LC_MESSAGES/
            messages.po
        it/
          LC_MESSAGES/
            messages.po

Generated files contains collected string, that you might want to translate. After you have finished translation you should compile all `po` files to `mo` format, that is understandable by Gettext. Use Artisan command to compile.

    php artisan polyglot:compile

Beside every `po` file will appear `mo` file.

> Do remember, that php caches contents of `mo` files. So, after compiling, be sure, you have restarted the web server.

### Compatability with Laravel Translator

Even using Gettext driver, you may continue to use Laravel translator directives, such as `trans` and `trans_choice`.

Meanwhile, you may use Gettext directives, such as `gettext`, `ngettext` and others.

They are all understandable by Polyglot.

Sometimes, you may want to keep existing translations as it is, and use `po` only for new strings. You may configure the array of translation keys, that should be stored into `php` files, not in `po`:

    'passthroughs' => [
        'validation.',
        'passwords.',
        'auth.',
        'pagination.',
        'verify.'
    ],

In that case, all strings that begins with configured values, will be stored in `php` files, following Laravel Translator style.

### Multiple Domains

Sometimes, you may want to divide your application's translation strings into few domains, e.g. strings for frontend and strings for administrative panel.

You may configure it that way:

    'domains' => [
      [
        'domain' => 'frontend', 
        'sources' => [
            app_path(),
            resource_path('views')
        ],
        'exclude' => resource_path('views/admin')
      ],
      [
        'domain' => 'admin', 
        'sources' => [
            resource_path('views/admin')
            resource_path('js/admin')
        ]
      ],
    ],

After collecting strings, every locale in `resource/lang` will get two files: `frontend.po` and `admin.po`.

By default, Polyglot will load into php memory the first configured domain. You may load next domain by accessing Laravel's `Lang` facade:

    Lang::setDomain('admin');

### Using Gettext in JavaScript

@todo   
experimental

Gettext does collect strings from JavaScript (and from Vue, but with some problems...). It is enough, if developer will define custom JavaScript functions: `gettext`, `ngettext` etc â€” Polyglot will reconize them.

Then loading you JavaScript app, just deliver the array of strings from back to front of your app.

    use Illuminate\Http\Request;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Lang;
    
    public function translations(Request $request)
    {
        return Lang::all(
            $request->get('locale'),
            $request->get('domain'),
        );
    }

## About Gettext

### Supported Directives

Polyglot supports the following Gettext directives.

Lookup a message in the current domain:

    gettext(string $message): string

Plural version of gettext:

    ngettext(string $singular, string $plural, int $count): string

Particular version of gettext allows to define context:

    pgettext(string $context, string $message): string

Particular version of ngettext.
  
    npgettext(string $context, string $singular, string $plural, int $count): string

> Other directives, that allows to override current domain and category, are not supported.

### The Power of Gettext

Gettext can be very helpful for the translator. Use following recipes to get localization done well.

#### References

Gettext extracts references of the string, so translator may suppose the context.

    #: /sources/php/second.php:3 /sources/js/first.js:1
    msgid "Short message"
    msgstr ""

#### Developer comments

Gettext may extract developer comment, that might be helpful for translator.

    #. The message will be shown at test page only.
    msgid "Hello world"
    msgstr ""

Originated from source code:

    // The message will be shown at test page only.
    echo gettext('Hello world');


#### Message context

The developer may explicitly define the message context.

    gettext('May');
    pgettext('Month', 'May');

Here we have two messages with equal `msgid` but with defferent `msgctxt` that is actually a part of string key.

    msgid "May"
    msgstr ""
    
    msgctxt "Month"
    msgid "May"
    msgstr ""

#### Translator comments

While editing strings, translator may left one or many comments. This comments may be helpful for future translators.

    # They say it was about posibilities...
    msgid "May"
    msgstr ""

#### Fuzzy strings

Both Gettext (while parsing source codes) and a translataor may mark string as fuzzy. It means that a string, previously situated on that place, was changed, so current translation might no longer be appropriate.

    #, fuzzy
    msgid "May"
    msgstr ""
